This app designed for android tablet, android phone, and Windows 11 can show you when the sun will rise and set at your location to the second.
It uses an API called sunrise-sunset.
It shows the current time and day length.
It also shows the current cordantates that the sunset are set to.
The app is writen using .NET MAUI with help from chat-gpt. I have not added this to Goggle Play though I plan to. The picures are from Google Images.
